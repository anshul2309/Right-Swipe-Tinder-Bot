I used pynput module to open terminal and type everything for you.

I used time.sleep so that if there is any delay, the software doesn't stop.



<B> CLICK ON THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON TO DOWNLOAD ON UPPER RIGHT SIDE AFTER CLICKING ON tinderbot.py.app.zip, or just copy the code and install all pyhton libraries included and test the software. </B>
